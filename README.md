## What is Euribor/Eurirs?
- [Euribor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euribor), **EUR**o **I**nter**B**ank **O**ffered **R**ate: daily reference rate based on the average based on the averaged interest rates at which Eurozone banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks.
- [Eurirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_swap), **EUR**o **I**nterest **R**ate **S**wap: an interest rate swap's (IRS's) effective description is a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies the nature of an exchange of payments benchmarked against an interest rate index.

## Why?
Seems like banks tune their loan interest rates to these two values. I want to visualize the change over the years.
